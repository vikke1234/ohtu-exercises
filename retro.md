Of the two retrospectives "Glad, Sad, Mad" and "Start, Stop, Continue, More of,
Less of Wheel" the latter is quite a bit simpler. It really only is that you
divide a cirle on a whiteboard into 5 sections with the titles start, stop,
continue, more of and less of". After which you simply start writing into the
sections what ever it is that might fit into it.

The "Glad, Sad, Mad" is a little more complex, you essentially make a bunch of
brief notes about issues or good things that happened that sprint and place
them on a whiteboard. This should take 10-15 minutes and the notes should be
brief, just enough to make your team understand what's happening. After making
the notes your team will then describe their notes.

    Next you divide the whiteboard into 3 categories: glad, sad and mad.
After which you start assigning the notes into the category that the author
feels. After all of the notes are assigned, they're grouped so that all notes
that relate to the same thing will are physically moved together. A single
person should do this.

When all of the notes are grouped together you then vote with your team which
issues should be discussed further. Finally the scrummaster or who ever is
in charge of the retrospective then leads the discussion which notes should be
covered in the next sprint.
